## How to Test

### Test 1: analyzer-creator

```
Ask Claude Code:
"Create a custom analyzer to check if my custom module Vendor_Module is enabled"

Expected:
- analyzer-creator agent invoked
- Complete PHP analyzer class provided
- YAML configuration provided
- Testing commands provided
- Documentation provided
```

### Test 2: analyzer-debugger

```
First create a broken analyzer (missing quotes in YAML), then ask:
"My analyzer isn't showing in --list-analyzers"

Expected:
- analyzer-debugger agent invoked
- Systematic diagnostic process
- Root cause identified (missing quotes)
- Specific fix provided
- Verification command provided
```

### Test 3: test-writer

```
After creating an analyzer:
"Write tests for my custom analyzer"

Expected:
- test-writer agent invoked
- Complete test class with multiple test cases
- Mock helpers provided
- Running commands provided
- Coverage summary provided
```

### Test 4: code-reviewer

```
After creating an analyzer:
"Review this analyzer code"

Expected:
- code-reviewer agent invoked
- Systematic review against checklist
- Issues categorized by severity
- Fixes with code examples
- Overall recommendation
```

### Test 5: documentation-updater

```
After adding a feature:
"Update documentation for my new analyzer"

Expected:
- documentation-updater agent invoked
- Identifies affected files
- Provides specific updates
- Explains rationale
```

### Test 6: performance-optimizer

```
After identifying a slow analyzer:
"My analyzer is taking 10 seconds to run, can you optimize it?"

Expected:
- performance-optimizer agent invoked
- Profiles and identifies bottleneck
- Applies optimization
- Measures improvement
- Verifies functionality preserved
```

## Testing Workflow Example

Complete end-to-end workflow:

```bash
# 1. Create analyzer
"Create an analyzer to monitor catalog_product_entity table size"
# → analyzer-creator provides complete implementation

# 2. Test it
n98-magerun2.phar performance:review --list-analyzers
n98-magerun2.phar performance:review --category=custom -v

# 3. If broken, debug
"It's not showing in the list"
# → analyzer-debugger diagnoses and fixes

# 4. Add tests
"Write tests for this analyzer"
# → test-writer creates comprehensive tests

# 5. Review code
"Review this code before I commit"
# → code-reviewer provides quality review

# 6. If slow, optimize
"It's taking 8 seconds to run"
# → performance-optimizer improves performance

# 7. Update docs
"Update documentation for this analyzer"
# → documentation-updater synchronizes docs

# 8. Commit!
git add .
git commit -m "Add product table size analyzer"
```

## Key Features

### 1. Proactive Invocation

Agents use "MUST BE USED" and "PROACTIVELY" in descriptions:
- analyzer-creator: Triggered by "create analyzer", "add performance check"
- analyzer-debugger: Triggered by "not working", "not loading"
- code-reviewer: Triggered by "review code"

### 2. Context Awareness

All agents:
- Read CLAUDE.md for patterns
- Gather context before acting
- Ask clarifying questions

### 3. Structured Workflows

Each agent follows a phase-by-phase workflow:
- Phase 1: Context gathering
- Phase 2: Analysis/Planning
- Phase 3: Implementation
- Phase 4: Verification
- Phase 5: Documentation

### 4. Success Criteria

Every agent has clear success criteria:
- What "done" looks like
- How to verify success
- What good output contains

### 5. Integration

Agents suggest next steps:
- analyzer-creator → test-writer or code-reviewer
- analyzer-debugger → code-reviewer
- code-reviewer → performance-optimizer or test-writer
- All → documentation-updater

## Improvements Over Original

| Aspect | Original | Improved |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **Structure** | Basic workflow | Phase-by-phase with clear goals |
| **Context** | Limited | Always reads CLAUDE.md, asks questions |
| **Output** | Code only | Structured report with verification |
| **Examples** | Few | Many scenarios with solutions |
| **Integration** | None | Suggests next agents to use |
| **Success Criteria** | Implied | Explicit checklist |
| **Error Handling** | Basic | Comprehensive troubleshooting |
| **Documentation** | Minimal | Comprehensive with README |

2. **Verify automatic invocation** works
3. **Test integration** between agents
4. **Check output quality** matches expectations

### Short-term (Refinement)

1. **Gather feedback** from actual usage
2. **Adjust prompts** based on what works
3. **Add team-specific patterns** if needed
4. **Document any issues** encountered

### Long-term (Optimization)

1. **Track which agents are used most**
2. **Identify common failure patterns**
3. **Add more examples** from real usage
4. **Share improvements** with team

## Maintenance

### Updating Agents

To modify an agent:

```bash
# Edit the agent file
vim .claude/agents/analyzer-creator.md

# Test the changes
# Ask Claude Code to use that agent

# Document changes
git commit -m "Improve analyzer-creator: add X"
```

### Keeping Agents Current

When code patterns change:

1. Update **CLAUDE.md** with new patterns
2. Agents automatically use updated patterns (they read CLAUDE.md)
3. Update agent-specific examples if needed

### Version Control

```bash
# Add to git
git add .claude/

# Commit
git commit -m "Add Claude Code sub-agents"

# Push for team
git push

# Now team can use same agents!
```

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Being Invoked

**Problem:** Claude Code doesn't use sub-agent

**Solutions:**
1. Use explicit: "Use the analyzer-creator agent"
2. Use trigger words: "create analyzer", "debug", "write tests"
3. Check file exists: `ls .claude/agents/`

### Agent Doesn't Work as Expected

**Problem:** Agent output isn't what you want

**Solutions:**
1. Edit the agent's .md file
2. Add your specific requirements
3. Test and iterate

### Agent Needs More Context

**Problem:** Agent doesn't know about recent changes

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure CLAUDE.md is up-to-date
2. Provide context in your request
3. Reference specific files or patterns

## Success Metrics

Track these to measure success:

- ✅ **Time saved:** How much faster is development?
- ✅ **Quality improved:** Fewer bugs, better code
- ✅ **Consistency:** All analyzers follow same patterns
- ✅ **Onboarding:** New devs productive faster
- ✅ **Documentation:** Always current
