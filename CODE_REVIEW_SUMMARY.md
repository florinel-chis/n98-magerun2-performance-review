## Changes Applied

### 1. Refined Trigger Keywords ✅

**analyzer-debugger** (Line 3):
```yaml
# BEFORE
description: Debug issues with Performance Review analyzers. Use this agent when analyzers aren't loading, not appearing in --list-analyzers, throwing errors, or producing unexpected results. MUST BE USED when user reports analyzer problems like "not working", "not loading", "not found", or "throwing errors".

# AFTER (more specific)
description: Debug Performance Review analyzer registration and runtime issues. MUST BE USED when user reports "analyzer not in --list-analyzers", "analyzer not loading", "analyzer class not found", "analyzer throwing errors during performance:review", or "analyzer produces no issues when it should". Use for analyzer-specific debugging only.
```

**Improvement:** Reduces false-positive triggers by being more specific about analyzer-related issues.

---

**test-writer** (Line 3):
```yaml
# BEFORE
description: Write PHPUnit tests for Performance Review analyzers. Use when new analyzers are created or existing ones are modified and need test coverage. Creates comprehensive unit tests covering happy paths, edge cases, and error conditions.

# AFTER (added explicit triggers)
description: Write PHPUnit tests for Performance Review analyzers. MUST BE USED when user says "create tests", "write tests", "add test coverage", or "need tests" for an analyzer. Use when new analyzers are created or existing ones are modified. Creates comprehensive unit tests covering happy paths, edge cases, and error conditions.
```

**Improvement:** Explicitly lists trigger phrases for more reliable automatic invocation.

---

### 2. Updated Model Selection ✅

**documentation-updater** (Line 4):
```yaml
# BEFORE
model: haiku

# AFTER
model: sonnet
```

**Reasoning:** Documentation updates require understanding context across multiple files, maintaining consistency, and ensuring technical accuracy - areas where sonnet excels. Haiku might be too lightweight for complex documentation tasks.

---

### 3. Added Test Verification Step ✅

**test-writer** (Lines 434-469):

**BEFORE:**
```markdown
### Phase 6: Run Tests

**Provide test execution commands:**

```bash
# Run specific test file
vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Unit/Analyzer/MyAnalyzerTest.php
...
```

**AFTER (with verification):**
```markdown
### Phase 6: Run and Verify Tests

**IMPORTANT: Always run tests before delivering to user**

```bash
# Run specific test file
vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Unit/Analyzer/MyAnalyzerTest.php

# Verify all tests pass
```

**Expected output:**
```
OK (X tests, Y assertions)
```

**If tests fail:**
1. Debug why tests fail
2. Fix either test expectations or analyzer implementation
3. Re-run until all pass
4. Only deliver passing tests to user

**Additional test commands:**
[test commands]
```

**Improvement:** Ensures agent verifies tests pass before delivering them to user, preventing broken tests from being delivered.

## Review Highlights

### Critical Issues Found
❌ **None** - No security or breaking issues identified

### Important Issues Found & Fixed
1. ✅ Trigger keywords too broad → Made more specific
2. ✅ Model selection suboptimal → Changed haiku to sonnet
3. ✅ Missing test verification → Added verification step
4. ❌ No emoji contradiction found (good!)

### Minor Issues (For Future)
1. Could add line number references to documentation links
2. Could include time estimates in success criteria
3. Could add "When Completing Task" checklist
4. Could condense some code-reviewer examples

---

## Security Assessment

✅ **All agents reviewed for security concerns:**

- No file system traversal vulnerabilities
- No arbitrary code execution risks
- Appropriate tool access (minimal permissions)
- Read-only agents correctly have no Write/Edit access
- No agents can modify core module files unexpectedly
- Bash commands are for testing only, no dangerous operations

**Verdict:** Secure for intended use.

---

## Tool Permission Audit

All agents have appropriate, minimal tool access:

| Agent | Tools | Assessment |
|-------|-------|------------|
| analyzer-creator | Read, Write, Bash, Glob | ✅ Appropriate (creates files, tests) |
| analyzer-debugger | Read, Bash, Grep, Glob | ✅ Appropriate (read-only debugging) |
| test-writer | Read, Write, Bash | ✅ Appropriate (creates tests, runs them) |
| code-reviewer | Read, Grep, Glob | ✅ Appropriate (read-only review) |
| documentation-updater | Read, Edit, Glob | ✅ Appropriate (edits docs) |
| performance-optimizer | Read, Edit, Grep, Bash | ✅ Appropriate (modifies code, tests) |

**No over-permissions found.**

---

## Consistency Analysis

### Structure: Excellent ✅
All agents follow similar structure with:
1. YAML frontmatter
2. Mission statement
3. "When To Use" / "When NOT To Use"
4. Phase-by-phase workflow
5. Output format
6. Success criteria
7. Integration suggestions
8. Documentation references

### Terminology: Consistent ✅
- "Analyzer" (not "analyser")
- "AnalyzerCheckInterface" (correct interface)
- "Collection" (for issues)
- "CLAUDE.md" (proper capitalization)
- Priority levels: high/medium/low

### Formatting: 95% Consistent ✅
Minor variations don't impact usability.

---

## Integration Assessment

### Workflow Coverage: Excellent ✅

**Primary workflow chains:**

1. **Create → Test → Review → Optimize → Document**
   ```
   analyzer-creator
   → test-writer
   → code-reviewer
   → performance-optimizer
   → documentation-updater
   ```

2. **Debug → Fix → Review → Test**
   ```
   analyzer-debugger
   → [manual fix]
   → code-reviewer
   → test-writer
   ```

### Handoff Clarity: Good ✅

Each agent clearly suggests next agents:
- analyzer-creator → test-writer, code-reviewer
- analyzer-debugger → other agents based on findings
- test-writer → analyzer-debugger (if tests fail), code-reviewer
- code-reviewer → test-writer, analyzer-debugger, performance-optimizer
- documentation-updater → completion (no further suggestions)
- performance-optimizer → test-writer, code-reviewer

**No gaps in workflow coverage identified.**

---

## Positive Aspects

### What's Done Really Well ✅

1. **Excellent Separation of Concerns** - Each agent has distinct purpose
2. **Comprehensive Examples** - Extensive code examples (correct & incorrect)
3. **Phase-by-Phase Workflows** - Systematic and predictable
4. **Strong Error Handling Guidance** - Emphasizes graceful degradation
5. **Clear Success Criteria** - Agents know when they're done
6. **Good Context Awareness** - References CLAUDE.md appropriately
7. **Appropriate Tool Access** - Minimal necessary permissions
8. **Practical Output Formats** - Structured, actionable information
9. **Integration-Aware** - Agents suggest appropriate handoffs
10. **Realistic Scenarios** - Common scenarios and anti-patterns

---

4. **code-reviewer**: "Review this analyzer code"
5. **documentation-updater**: "Update docs for new analyzer"
6. **performance-optimizer**: "Optimize this slow analyzer"

### Test Integration

Run complete workflow:
1. Create analyzer
2. Write tests
3. Review code
4. Update documentation
5. Optimize if needed
